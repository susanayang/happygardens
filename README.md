**Project Name:**   **Happy Garden**

**Application Description:**  
A multiplayer web game for long-distance friends, couples, or families who want to stay connected. Players share a digital garden where they can plant and grow flowers together asynchronously or synchronously. The game is a casual way of interacting and maintaining emotional closeness despite long distances.

**Features + Tools/Tech:**  
- User Account & Garden Selection: Players create an account and either join an existing shared garden or start a new one. (Node.js, MongoDB, JavaScript)
- Flower Planting & Harvesting: Players can plant flowers that grow over time and are later harvested. Growth is accelerated when more players are online. (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Bulletin Board: A shared board where players leave notes, thoughts, or updates for each other. (MongoDB, JavaScript)
- Basic UI & Garden Visualization: A cozy and cute visual layout that displays the garden and interactive elements. (HTML, CSS, React)

**Timeline:**  
4/26: Basic web layout + account & game creation <br/>
4/28: Planting & growing flowers + bulletin board <br/>
5/1: Add fancier UI <br/>

**Potential Future Exanpsion Ideas:**  
- Customizable scarecrow avatars to reflect moods
- In-game currency to unlock more flower types or garden sections
- Light animations or sound effects for ambience
- Notifications when friends visit or leave notes
- Mood-tracking plants that grow differently depending on shared player input
